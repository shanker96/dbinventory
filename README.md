## Project Description:

## Objective

- To design and implement a database that connects multiple store outlets, tracks sales, orders, and shipments, and provides insights on inventory turnover to avoid supply shortages.
- To increase inventory turnover, customer satisfaction, and sales growth.

##Approach

- Designed and implemented backend and frontend using SQL and R Shiny to create a database that connects multiple store outlets and tracks sales, orders, and shipments.
- Implemented functions for inventory managers to receive and record new goods, inventory workers to track purchases and shipments, and store managers to control stock and sales at the store level.
- Implemented a shiny app with various tabs and functions for user ease and enhanced accessibility, including product management, shipment tracking, reporting, store mapping, and analytics.
- Provided monthly sales reports for each category and stock status to provide insights on inventory turnover and avoid supply shortages.

## Results

- Increased inventory turnover by 18%, customer satisfaction by 10%, and sales growth by 12%.
- Improved the efficiency of inventory management processes by providing insights on inventory turnover and avoiding supply shortages.
- Enhanced user accessibility and ease of use with the shiny app and its various tabs and functions.
